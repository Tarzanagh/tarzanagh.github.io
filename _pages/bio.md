I am an AI Scientist at Samsung SDS Research America, Mountain View.

I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania with Li Shen and Qi Long, and at the University of Michigan with Laura Balzano. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Florida in 2020, co-advised by William Hager and George Michailidis.
