I am an AI Scientist at Samsung SDS Research America, Mountain View. I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania with [Li Shen](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9075258) and [Qi Long](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8939931), and at the University of Michigan with [Laura Balzano](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/?page_id=10). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Florida in 2020, co-advised by [William Hager](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/hager/) and [George Michailidis](https://georgemichailidis.github.io/).
