My name is Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, a postdoctoral researcher of [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) . I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Florida in 2020 under the supervision of Profs. William W. Hager and George Michailidis.  My current interests include understanding machine learning through a detailed understanding of optimization, online learning, algorithmic fairness, and practical data analysis.
