I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania, hosted by [Li Shen](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9075258) and [Qi Long](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8939931). I am also affiliated with ASSET (Center for AI-enabled systems: Safe, Explainable, and Trustworthy). Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, hosted by [Laura Balzano](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Florida in 2020, where I was co-advised by [William W. Hager](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/hager/) and [George Michailidis](https://informatics.research.ufl.edu/homepage-2/about-us/michailidis.html).

## Current Research Interests

### Optimization Algorithms for Machine Learning Problems
Study the optimization landscape of machine learning problems and develop online, federated, and distributed algorithms for solving these problems with provable guarantees.

  arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.02829, 2022.
  
### Implicit Bias of Transformers and Large Language Models
Providing optimization methods that not only minimize the training error objective but also prefer simple solutions, ultimately leading to good test error.
