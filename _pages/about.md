<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania, mentored by Professors <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9075258">Li Shen</a> and <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8939931">Qi Long</a>. I am also affiliated with ASSET (Center for AI-enabled systems: Safe, Explainable and Trustworthy). Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, mentored by Professor <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/">Laura Balzano</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Florida in 2020 under the supervision of Professors <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/hager/">William W. Hager</a> and <a href="https://informatics.research.ufl.edu/homepage-2/about-us/michailidis.html">George Michailidis</a>.</p>
