I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania, hosted by [Li Shen](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9075258) and [Qi Long](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8939931). I am also affiliated with ASSET (Center for AI-enabled systems: Safe, Explainable, and Trustworthy). Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, hosted by [Laura Balzano](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/?page_id=10). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Florida in 2020, where I was co-advised by [William W. Hager](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/hager/) and [George Michailidis](https://georgemichailidis.github.io/).
