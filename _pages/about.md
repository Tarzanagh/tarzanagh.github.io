I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), mentored by Profs. [Li Shen](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9075258) and [Qi Long](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8939931).  I am also associated with  [ASSET (Center for AI-enabled systems: Safe, Explainable and Trustworthy)](https://asset.seas.upenn.edu/). Previously, I was a  post-doctoral researcher in [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/), mentored by Prof. [Laura Balzano](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Florida in 2020 under the supervision of Profs. [William W. Hager](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/hager/) and [George Michailidis](https://informatics.research.ufl.edu/homepage-2/about-us/michailidis.html).

## Research Interests:
- **Optimization Algorithms for Machine Learning Problems:**  
  Study the optimization landscape of machine learning problems and develop online, federated, and distributed algorithms for solving these problems with provable guarantees.
- **Implicit Bias of Transformers and Large Language Models:**  
  Providing optimization methods that not only minimize the training error objective but also prefer simple solutions, ultimately leading to good test error.
- **Fairness in Machine Learning:**  
  Develop probabilistic algorithms correcting biases in the machine learning models.
- **High Dimensional and Network Data Analysis:**  
  Develop scalable algorithms with provable performance guarantees for learning from high-dimensional and network data including graphical models and time series.
