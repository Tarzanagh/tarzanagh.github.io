I am an AI Scientist at Samsung SDS Research America in Mountain View, where I work on developing AI systems for enterprise data analytics. My research focuses on the mathematical foundations of Transformers and LLMs, the optimization of AI and multi-agent systems, graph-based reasoning and retrieval, and trustworthy AI (fairness, privacy, and robustness).
