I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania, mentored by Profs. [Li Shen](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9075258) and [Qi Long](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8939931).  I am also affiliated with ASSET (Center for AI-enabled systems: Safe, Explainable and Trustworthy). Previously, I was a  post-doctoral researcher in Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, mentored by Prof. [Laura Balzano](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Florida in 2020 under the supervision of Profs. [William W. Hager](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/hager/) and [George Michailidis](https://informatics.research.ufl.edu/homepage-2/about-us/michailidis.html).

<h2>Current Research Interests:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Optimization Algorithms for Machine Learning Problems:</strong><br>Study the optimization landscape of machine learning problems and develop online, federated, and distributed algorithms for solving these problems with provable guarantees.</li>
  <li><strong>Implicit Bias of Transformers and Large Language Models:</strong><br>Providing optimization methods that not only minimize the training error objective but also prefer simple solutions, ultimately leading to good test error.</li>
  <li><strong>Fairness in Machine Learning:</strong><br>Develop probabilistic algorithms correcting biases in the machine learning models.</li>
  <li><strong>High Dimensional and Network Data Analysis:</strong><br>Develop scalable algorithms with provable performance guarantees for learning from high-dimensional and network data, including graphical models and time series.</li>
</ul>
